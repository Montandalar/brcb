# Example Modular Architecture for Minetest Mods: Bricks and Compressed Nodes

## Introduction

This modpack is meant as an example of a good modular architecture for a
Minetest modpack or group of related mods, where dependencies are resolved by
the engine's own dependency system properly and there are no circular
dependencies and no mods with dependencies that need to be inverted.
